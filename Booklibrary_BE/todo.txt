                        Possible improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-- check log4jdbc library for db requests logging
-- Usage of gridfs for file storage
-- Next time better use MongoTrek for db migration

-- If use MongoCK, better to generate all requests to 3rd party sources
    (autogenerated data) in Java code instead of separate bash/python
    scripts.

-- Use Hystrix and Feign to download books data via google API
    (maybe even move this functionality to separate microservice)

-- Think about "process status" endpoints
